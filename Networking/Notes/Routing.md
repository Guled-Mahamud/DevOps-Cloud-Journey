# What is Routing? 

**Routing** is the process of **finding the best** path for data to travel across a network from one device to another. It helps computers, phones, and other devices communicate over the internet or within a local network.


## How Does Routing Work?

1️⃣ **You request a website** (e.g., www.google.com).

2️⃣ Your request is **sent to a router** (like your Wi-Fi router).

3️⃣ The router **determines the best path** to send your data to Google’s servers.

4️⃣ Google’s server **sends data back**, following the best route.

5️⃣ You see the website load on your screen!




 ## Types of Routing

✅ Static Routing – Manually set routes (used in small networks).

✅ Dynamic Routing – Routes automatically updated using protocols like OSPF, BGP (used in large networks).


## Why is Routing Important?

🚀 Ensures fast and efficient data delivery.

🌍 Helps connect millions of devices worldwide.

🔄 Provides backup paths in case of network failures.



## What is a Routing Table?

A **routing table** is a list of paths stored in a router. It tells the router **where to send data** based on destination IP addresses.

📌 **Think of a routing table like a GPS**: It lists different routes and helps the router pick the fastest one.



## Example of Routing (Real-World Analogy)

- Imagine **sending a letter** to a friend in another city.

- The post office **(router)** checks the address and decides the best route.

- The letter travels through different **postal centers (routers on the internet).**

- It finally arrives at your friend’s house **(destination IP address).**
