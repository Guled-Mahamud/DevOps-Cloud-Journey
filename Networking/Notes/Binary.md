# What is Binary?

In the **binary system,** data is represented using just **two digits: 1 and 0.** These are called binary digits, or bits for short. Every bit represents a single value, either 1 or 0.

To understand this, imagine you have a light switch. The light can either be on (1) or off (0). Computers use this on/off state (1 or 0) to process and store data.

### Why do computers use binary?

It’s because electronic circuits in computers can easily represent these two states: on (1) and off (0). It’s much easier for electronics to work with two states (like an electrical charge being present or not) than trying to manage more complex signals.

### What does a sequence of binary numbers mean?

A sequence of binary digits (bits) can represent numbers, letters, images, and pretty much anything else in computing! Let’s break down a simple example with numbers.

### Decimal vs. Binary

Humans usually work with the decimal system (base 10), which has 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. But computers work with binary, which only has 2 digits: 0 and 1.

When we write numbers in binary, each bit represents a power of 2 (just like in decimal, each digit represents a power of 10). Here’s how it works:

### Understanding Binary Numbers:

Let’s look at the number 13 in binary.

1. Decimal (base 10) 13 needs to be converted to binary.

2. To do this, we start by dividing 13 by 2, keeping track of the remainders.

- 13 ÷ 2 = 6, remainder = 1

- 6 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder = 0

- 3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder = 1

- 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder = 1
