# Ports & Protocols: TCP, UDP


**Ports:** Ports are like doors on a device that allow different types of network traffic to enter and exit. Each port number is associated with a specific service or application. For example, web traffic usually uses port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS).


**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A protocol used for reliable communication. It ensures that data is sent and received in the correct order and that all data reaches its destination. TCP is commonly used for things like web browsing and file transfers, where accuracy is crucial.


**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** A faster, but less reliable protocol. Unlike TCP, it doesn't guarantee that data will arrive in order or that all data will make it. UDP is used for real-time applications like video streaming or online gaming, where speed is more important than accuracy.



## Ports:


- **What they are:** Ports are like "doorways" on a device that allow different types of network traffic to enter and exit. Each port is assigned a number.

- **How they work:** When data is sent over a network, it’s directed to a specific port on the destination device based on the type of service or application. For example, web traffic uses port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS), while email might use port 25 (SMTP).

- **Example:** Port 80 is used for web traffic, meaning when you access a website, your device uses port 80 to communicate with the web server.

 
## Protocols:

- **What they are:** Protocols are sets of rules that define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received over a network. They determine the way devices communicate with each other.

- **How they work:** Protocols ensure that data is transferred correctly and reliably between devices. Common protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

- **Example:** TCP is used to ensure reliable communication by checking that all data is received correctly, while UDP is faster but doesn’t guarantee data delivery.


**In Summary:**

**Ports** are like channels that direct traffic to the right place on a device.

**Protocols** are the rules that govern how that data is sent and received over the network.
