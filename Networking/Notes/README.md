# Networking/Notes :infinity:


- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Networking connects servers, containers, and environments, enabling automated deployment and testing.

- **Microservices**: Ensures smooth communication between microservices, often via APIs or messaging queues.

- **Cloud Scalability**: Manages traffic flow, resource allocation, and security in cloud environments (e.g., VPCs, load balancing).

- **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**: Tracks network health, helps identify performance issues, and resolves connectivity problems.

- **Security**: Controls access with firewalls, VPNs, and encryption, ensuring secure communication.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automates network setup (subnets, routing) for consistent, error-free deployments.
