#  IP address & MAC address

**IP Address:** This is a unique identifier for a device on a network, allowing it to send and receive data. It acts like an address for devices, so they can find and communicate with each other. There are two versions:

- **IPv4:** The most widely used version, consisting of four sets of numbers (each between 0-255) separated by dots, such as 192.168.1.1. It provides around 4 billion unique addresses.

- **IPv6:** A newer version that uses longer alphanumeric addresses, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). It’s designed to handle the growing number of devices online and offers a vastly larger number of addresses than IPv4.



**MAC Address:** This is a unique hardware identifier assigned to the network interface card (NIC) of a device, such as a computer’s Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter. The MAC address is used for communication within a local network (LAN) and is fixed by the manufacturer. It's often written in 6 pairs of characters (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E). Unlike an IP address, which can change depending on the network, the MAC address stays the same for the device.
