#  LAN & WAN

**LAN (Local Area Network):** A network that connects devices within a small geographic area, like a home, office, or school. It typically uses wired or wireless connections to share resources such as files, printers, and internet access.

**WAN (Wide Area Network):** A network that spans a large geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs over long distances, like across cities or countries. The internet is the largest example of a WAN.
