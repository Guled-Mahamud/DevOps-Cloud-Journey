# Key Networking Components

**Switch:** A device that connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data between them based on MAC addresses. It helps direct network traffic efficiently within the local network.



**Router:** A device that connects different networks (e.g., LAN to WAN) and directs data between them using IP addresses. It manages traffic between your local network and the internet.



**Firewall:** A security device (hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It enforces security rules to protect the network from unauthorized access or threats.
