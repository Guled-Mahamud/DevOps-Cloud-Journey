# OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model from both the Sender and Receiver's point of view

## Sender's Perspective (Sending the Data)

You (Sender) write a letter and send it step by step through the 7 OSI layers:

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7) → Writing the Letter**

- You type a message on your phone (e.g., email, WhatsApp, web browser).


2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6) → Formatting the Letter**

- The letter is written in a specific language (e.g., English). If needed, it's **translated, encrypted, or compressed** (like converting text to binary).


3. **Session Layer (Layer 5) → Creating an Envelope**

- You decide to send the letter via a session (single or multiple messages in a conversation).


4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4) → Adding a Stamp & Tracking Number**

- Ensures reliable delivery (like **TCP** for reliability, **UDP** for speed).

- Splits the message into packets (like pages in a book).

5. **Network Layer (Layer 3) → Writing the Address**

- Adds sender and receiver addresses (**IP address** in networking).

- Chooses the best route for delivery.

6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2) → Handing it to the Post Office**

- Adds a MAC address (like a return address).

- Ensures the letter reaches the correct recipient inside the same area/network.

7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1) → Sending the Letter Physically**

- The post office **physically** delivers the letter via cables, Wi-Fi, or fiber optics.

- The letter is transmitted as electrical signals or light pulses.
Receiver's Perspective (Receiving the Data)


## Your friend (Receiver) gets the letter and processes it in reverse order:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1) → Receives the Letter**

- Letter arrives via post/mail carrier (network cables, Wi-Fi).


2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2) → Confirms Receipt**

- Checks if the letter is addressed to the right recipient (MAC address verification).

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3) → Reads the Address**

- Uses the IP address to confirm it's meant for them.

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4) → Reassembles the Letter**

- If it was split into multiple envelopes (packets), they are reassembled.
Ensures the full message is received correctly.

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5) → Opens the Envelope**

- Ensures it's part of an ongoing conversation (e.g., continuing a chat).

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6) → Decodes the Message**

- Translates the language if needed (decryption, decompression).

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7) → Reads the Letter**

- Finally, your friend reads your message in their email, WhatsApp, or browser.


### Key Takeaways

**Sender:** Breaks the message down, adds addresses, and sends it.

**Receiver:** Collects, verifies, and rebuilds the message.

**Data flows downward** in OSI layers when sending and upward when receiving.
