# Networking  	


In computing, networking refers to the practice of connecting computers, devices, or systems together to share resources, data, and enable communication. This can involve both local and wide area networks, and it's a crucial part of how the internet and other communication systems function. Networking enables devices to communicate, share files, access the internet, and perform a variety of other tasks.


## Key Concepts in Computing Networking:


### Networking Types:

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network of devices within a small geographic area, like a home, office, or school.

- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A network that covers a large geographic area, often using leased telecommunication lines or the internet to connect distant LANs.

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** A network that spans a city or large campus area.



### Protocols:

- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: The foundational protocol suite for the internet, governing how data is transmitted and routed across networks.

- **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Used for web browsing and communication between web servers and browsers.

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol used to transfer files between devices on a network.

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.




### Devices in Networking:

- **Router**: A device that forwards data packets between different networks (e.g., your home network and the internet).

- **Switch**: A device that connects devices within the same network, forwarding data based on MAC addresses.

- **Hub**: Similar to a switch but less efficient, it simply broadcasts data to all devices in a network.

- **Modem**: Converts digital data from your computer into signals that can be transmitted over phone lines, cables, or other media, and vice versa.



### IP Addressing:

Every device on a network typically has a unique identifier called an IP address (Internet Protocol address). This can be either IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or IPv6 (a newer version with more addresses available).


### Subnetting:

This is the practice of dividing a larger network into smaller sub-networks (subnets) to improve performance and security.



### Security:

- **Firewalls**: Hardware or software systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.


- **Encryption**: The process of encoding data to protect it from unauthorized access while it's transmitted over the network.
