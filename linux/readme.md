# Linux learning

I started learning Linux and obtained some fundamental knowledge, which has served as a solid foundation for me. Linux is critical for DevOps since it powers numerous tools and servers. I learnt simple commands such as ls to list files, cd to navigate between folders, and pwd to find my present location. I practiced making folders with mkdir, copying files with cp, relocating or renaming files with mv, and deleting files with rm.

I also used cat to inspect file content, nano/vim to edit files, and grep to find text within files. Understanding file permissions was new and interesting, so I practiced changing them with chmod. These commands allow me to better navigate and administer Linux computers.

Learning Linux has been a great start, and I’m excited to dive deeper into more advanced topics. It’s an essential skill for working with servers and DevOps tools.
