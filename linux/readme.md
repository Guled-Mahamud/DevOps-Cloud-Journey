# Linux learning

**What is Linux and Why It’s Important for DevOps and Cloud?**

Linux is an operating system that is free, open-source, and widely used in servers, cloud computing, and DevOps environments. It powers many technologies, from web servers to cloud platforms, because it’s reliable, secure, and flexible. Most DevOps tools, like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, work best on Linux. Knowing Linux is important for managing servers, deploying applications, and automating tasks in the cloud.

**What Will I Learn in Linux?**

Learning Linux includes understanding basic commands like creating files, moving them, and checking system status. You’ll learn how to manage user accounts, permissions, and file systems. Networking commands, process management, and scripting with Bash are also part of it. These skills are essential for troubleshooting, automating tasks, and managing servers.

Linux is the foundation for most cloud and DevOps work, making it an important step in my learning journey to becoming a DevOps/Cloud Engineer.
