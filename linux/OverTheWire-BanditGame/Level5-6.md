üé≤ Bandit Level 5 ‚Üí Level 6
üîä Level Objective
Your goal in this level is to locate a file within the inhere directory that is human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, and not executable. This file contains the password for the next level, Bandit6.

‚úèÔ∏è Commands You‚Äôll Need
SSH: Securely connect to the Bandit server.
ls: List files in a directory.
cd: Change directories.
find: Search for files based on specific criteria.
file: Check the type of a file.
cat: View the contents of a file.
exit: Log out from the server.

üí° Reminder: Always write down the passwords as you progress through the levels.

üìÉ Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server
Start by connecting to the Bandit server using SSH with the Bandit5 username and the password from the previous level.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
When prompted, enter the password you retrieved from Level 4.

Step 2: Locate the inhere Directory
After logging in, check the files and directories in the home directory. You will find a directory named inhere.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
ls
Explanation:

ls: Lists all files and directories in the current directory.
Step 3: Navigate into the inhere Directory
Move into the inhere directory to search for the target file.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
cd inhere
Explanation:

cd: Changes your current directory to the specified one.
Step 4: Search for the Target File
Use the find command to search for a file with the specified characteristics: 1033 bytes in size, human-readable, and not executable.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
Explanation:

find .: Searches in the current directory and subdirectories.
-type f: Limits the search to files only.
-size 1033c: Finds files that are exactly 1033 bytes in size (c = bytes).
! -executable: Excludes executable files.
The output will show the path of the file that matches these criteria.

Step 5: Verify the File
To confirm that the file is human-readable, use the file command on the identified file.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
file ./filename
(Replace filename with the name of the file from Step 4.)

Explanation:

file: Displays the type of the file. Look for ‚ÄúASCII text‚Äù or similar in the output.
Step 6: Read the Contents of the File
Once you have confirmed the correct file, use the cat command to read its contents.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
cat ./filename
(Replace filename with the name of the file from Step 4.)

Explanation:

cat: Displays the contents of the file. This will reveal the password for the next level.
Step 7: Log Out
After retrieving the password, log out of the server to complete this level.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
exit
Explanation:

exit: Ends your terminal session and disconnects you from the server.
:round_pushpin: Key Commands Recap

üîë Password for Level 6: (Copy the password displayed in Step 6 for future use.)

üîé Thought Process
This level introduces the find command, which is a powerful tool for locating files based on specific attributes like size and permissions. Combined with file and cat, this approach ensures you can locate and verify the correct file efficiently. These skills are essential for working with large file systems in Linux environments.
