# üé≤ Bandit Level 5 ‚Üí Level 6


## üîä Level Objective


Your goal in this level is to locate a file within the **inhere** directory that is **human-readable**, **1033 bytes in size**, and **not executable**. This file contains the password for the next level, **Bandit6**.


### ‚úèÔ∏è Commands You‚Äôll Need

:asterisk: **SSH**: Securely connect to the Bandit server.

:asterisk: **ls**: List files in a directory.

:asterisk: **cd**: Change directories.

:asterisk: **find**: Search for files based on specific criteria.

:asterisk: **file**: Check the type of a file.

:asterisk: **cat**: View the contents of a file.

:asterisk: **exit**: Log out from the server.


üí° Reminder: Always write down the passwords as you progress through the levels.



## üìÉ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server


Start by connecting to the Bandit server using **SSH** with the **Bandit5** username and the password from the previous level.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command: ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220**

When prompted, enter the password you retrieved from the previous level.


### Step 2: Locate the inhere Directory

After logging in, check the files and directories in the home directory. You will find a directory named inhere.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command: ls**

**Explanation**: **ls** Lists all files and directories in the current directory.



### Step 3: Navigate into the inhere Directory


Move into the inhere directory to search for the target file.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command: cd inhere**

**Explanation**: **cd** Changes your current directory to the specified one.


### Step 4: Search for the Target File

Use the find command to search for a file with the specified characteristics: 1033 bytes in size, human-readable, and not executable.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command: find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable**

**Explanation:**

**find .**: Searches in the current directory and subdirectories.

**-type f**: Limits the search to files only.

**-size 1033c**: Finds files that are exactly 1033 bytes in size (c = bytes).

**! -executable**: Excludes executable files.


The output will show the path of the file that matches these criteria.

**Output:**

./-file10: ASCII text ./-file15: ASCII text ./-file20: data

Here, files marked as **ASCII text** are human-readable, and one of them will be **1033 bytes in size**.



### Step 5: Verify the File

Once you have confirmed the correct file, use the cat command to read its contents.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command: cat ./-file10**

**Explanation**: **cat** Displays the contents of the file. This will reveal the password for the next level.


### Step 7: Log Out

After retrieving the password, log out of the server to complete this level.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command: exit**
