üé≤ Bandit Level 15 ‚Üí Level 16
üîä Level Objective
The goal is to retrieve the password for Bandit16 by submitting the password for the current level (Bandit15) to port 30001 on localhost. The communication must use SSL/TLS encryption.

‚úèÔ∏è Commands You‚Äôll Need
SSH: Securely connect to the Bandit server.
openssl s_client: Establish an SSL/TLS connection and send the password.
exit: Log out from the server.

üí° Reminder: Always write down the passwords as you progress through the levels.

üìÉ Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server
Start by connecting to the Bandit server using SSH with the Bandit15 username and the password from the previous level.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
When prompted, enter the password you retrieved from Level 14.

Step 2: Use OpenSSL to Connect to Port 30001
Connect to the server on port 30001 using the openssl s_client command to establish an SSL/TLS connection.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
Explanation:

openssl s_client: A tool used to interact with SSL/TLS-enabled services.
-connect localhost:30001: Specifies the host (localhost) and port (30001) to connect to using SSL/TLS.
Step 3: Submit the Password
After successfully connecting to the server, paste the password for Bandit15 and press Enter.

Important Notes:

If the connection is successful, you will see SSL/TLS handshake information followed by a prompt to send input.
If you encounter messages like DONE, RENEGOTIATING, or KEYUPDATE, refer to the CONNECTED COMMANDS section in the OpenSSL manpage for troubleshooting. These messages indicate the SSL/TLS connection is established, but the server is waiting for further input.
Step 4: Retrieve the Password for the Next Level
The server will respond with the password for Bandit16. Copy this password for use in the next level.

Step 5: Log Out
After retrieving the password, log out from the Bandit server.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
exit

:one: SSH: Connect to the Bandit server.
:two: openssl s_client: Establish an SSL/TLS connection to the server.
:three: exit: Log out from the Bandit server.

üîë Password for Level 16: (Copy the server's response for future use.)

üîé Thought Process
This level introduces SSL/TLS encryption and shows how to interact with encrypted services.

openssl s_client is a vital tool for establishing secure connections, often used in testing and troubleshooting SSL/TLS configurations.
Understanding how to securely send and receive data is essential for network security and system administration.
