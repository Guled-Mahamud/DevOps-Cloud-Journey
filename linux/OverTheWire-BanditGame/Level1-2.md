# 🎲 Bandit Level 1 → Level 2



## 🔊 Level Objective
Your task in this level is to locate a file named - in the home directory of the Bandit1 user. This file contains the password for the next level, Bandit2.



### ✏️ Commands You’ll Need

**SSH**: Securely connect to the Bandit server.

**ls**: List files in a directory.

**cat**: View the contents of a file.

**exit**: Log out from the server.



💡 **Reminder**: Always note down the **passwords** as you progress through the levels.




## 📃 Step-by-Step Solution


### Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server

To start, connect to the Bandit server using SSH with the Bandit1 username and the password from the previous level.

Run the command: **ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220**


When prompted, enter the password you retrieved from previous level



### Step 2: List Files in the Directory


After logging in, check the files in the home directory to locate the file named -.

Run the command: **ls**


**ls**: Lists all files in the current directory. You should see a file named -.



### Step 3: Read the Contents of the File Named -


Files with special names like - can cause confusion because - is often treated as a command option. To handle this, use a workaround to specify the file explicitly.

Run the command: **cat ./-**


**cat**: Reads and displays the contents of a file.

**./-**: The **./** tells the system to treat **-**as a file in the current directory, not as a command option.

The output will display the password for Level 2.
