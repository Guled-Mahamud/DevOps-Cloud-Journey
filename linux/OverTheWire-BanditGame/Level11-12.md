# üé≤ Bandit Level 11 ‚Üí Level 12



## üîä Level Objective


The password for the next level is stored in a file named **data.txt**. In this file, all **lowercase (a-z)** and **uppercase (A-Z)** letters have been rotated by **13 positions (ROT13)**. Your task is to decode the text to retrieve the password.




### ‚úèÔ∏è Commands You‚Äôll Need

:asterisk: **cat** View the contents of a file.

:asterisk:**tr** Translate or replace characters in a file.

:asterisk: **exit** Log out from the server.




üí° **Reminder**: Always write down the **passwords** as you progress through the levels.



## üìÉ Step-by-Step Solution


### Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server


Start by connecting to the **Bandit** server using **SSH** with the Bandit11 username and the password from the previous level.


:white_check_mark: **Run the command: ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220**

When prompted, enter the password you retrieved from the previous level.



### Step 2: View the Contents of data.txt

After logging in, locate and view the content of data.txt to analyze the file.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command: cat data.txt**


**Expected Output:** The file will contain scrambled text encoded with the ROT13 cipher.



### Step 3: Decode the Text Using tr

To decode the text, use the tr command to perform **ROT13** transformation. **ROT13** shifts letters by 13 positions in the alphabet, so a becomes n, b becomes o, and so on.


:white_check_mark: **Run the command: cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'**


**Explanation:**

- **cat data.txt** Displays the content of the file.

- **tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'** Translates each letter using ROT13.

- **'A-Za-z'**: Specifies all uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.

- **'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'**: Maps each letter to its ROT13 equivalent.


**Expected Output**:
After decoding, the plain text password will be shown in your terminal. It will look something like: **7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4**


üîë Password for Level 12: **7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4**



### Step 4: Log Out

After retrieving the password, log out from the server.


:white_check_mark: **Run the command: exit**




### :round_pushpin: Key Commands Recap

:one: **cat** View the contents of the file.

:two: **tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'** Decode text using the ROT13 cipher.

:three: **exit**: Log out from the Bandit server.








### üîé Thought Process


:arrow_right: This level introduces the concept of text encoding and decoding, specifically the **ROT13 cipher**.

:arrow_right: The tr command is a simple and efficient tool for text transformations, making it ideal for this task.

:arrow_right: **ROT13** is commonly used in puzzles or obfuscation, and understanding it helps with basic cryptography challenges.

:arrow_right: Decoding files like this is a common task in security challenges and system scripts.
