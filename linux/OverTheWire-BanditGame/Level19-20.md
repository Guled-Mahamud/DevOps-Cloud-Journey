🎲 Bandit Level 19 → Level 20
🔊 Level Objective
There is a setuid binary in the home directory that connects to localhost on a port you specify as a command-line argument. It reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password for the current level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it transmits the password for the next level (bandit21).

✏️ Commands You’ll Need
ls: List files in a directory.
chmod: Change file permissions.
nc (Netcat): Create a listening server.
./[binary_name]: Execute the setuid binary.
exit: Log out from the server.
💡 Reminder: Always write down the passwords as you progress through the levels.

📃 Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server
Log in to the Bandit server using SSH with the Bandit19 username and the password from Level 18.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
When prompted, enter the password from Level 18.

Step 2: Locate the Setuid Binary
Once connected, list the files in the home directory to find the setuid binary.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
ls
Expected Output:
You should see a file, likely named something like bandit20-do.

Step 3: Understand the Binary
The binary requires a port number as an argument. It connects to the specified port on localhost, reads input, and compares it to the current password. To retrieve the next password, you need to:

Start a server listening on a chosen port.
Provide the current password when the binary connects.
Step 4: Start a Listening Server
Use Netcat (nc) to start a server that listens on a port of your choice (e.g., 12345).

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
nc -l -p 12345
Explanation:

nc: Starts Netcat.
-l: Enables listening mode.
-p 12345: Specifies the port to listen on (you can use any unused port).
Step 5: Execute the Binary
In a second terminal, connect to the same server and execute the setuid binary, specifying the port you chose.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
./bandit20-do 12345
Explanation:

./bandit20-do: Executes the binary.
12345: Specifies the port to connect to (the one your server is listening on).
Step 6: Provide the Current Password
When the binary connects to the server (via Netcat), it waits for input. Provide the password for Level 19 (current level).

In the Netcat terminal, type:

csharp
Copy code
[password from Level 19]
Press Enter after typing the password.

Expected Output:
If the password is correct, the binary sends back the password for Level 20 (bandit21).

Step 7: Log Out
After retrieving the password, log out from the server.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
exit
:round_pushpin: Key Commands Recap
:one: ls: Identify the setuid binary.
:two: nc -l -p [port]: Start a listening server on the specified port.
:three: ./[binary_name] [port]: Run the binary, connecting it to the listening server.
:four: Provide the current password: Enter the Level 19 password when prompted.

🔑 Password for Level 20: (Copy the output from Netcat for future use.)

🔎 Thought Process
This level tests your understanding of:

Inter-process communication: The binary connects to a local server (your Netcat instance).
Setuid binaries: These run with elevated permissions, allowing you to retrieve sensitive information.
Networking basics: Setting up and managing local servers and connections.
By combining these tools and concepts, you can simulate a networked interaction and retrieve the next password effectively.
