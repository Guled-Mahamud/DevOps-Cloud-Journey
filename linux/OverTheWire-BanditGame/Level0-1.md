Once logged in, you will be in the **home directory** of bandit0.



### Step 1: List the Files in the Home Directory

**Objective**: After logging in, your goal is to see which files are available in your current directory (home directory).

**Why This Step is Important**: Bandit Level 0 contains a file named readme, which holds the password for the next level. You need to locate it.

**How to Do It**:

:white_check_mark:**Run the command: ls**


**ls**: This is the command used to list files and directories in your current working directory.


### Step 2: Read the Contents of the readme File

**Objective**: Open and view the contents of the readme file to find the password for the next level.

**Why This Step is Important**: The password for the next level is stored inside the readme file. You need to read it to continue to the next step in the game.

**How to Do It**:

:white_check_mark:**Run the command: cat**


**cat**: This command is used to display the contents of a file. It stands for "concatenate" and is commonly used to view text files in Linux.


**Expected Outcome**: The content of the readme file will be shown, which is the password for the next level. For Level 1, the password will be displayed directly in the terminal.

### Step 3: Log Out 

**Objective**: After obtaining the password, it's a good practice to log out of the server and end your session.

**Why This Step is Important**: Logging out is a good habit in any system, ensuring that no one else can access your session.

**How to Do It**:

:white_check_mark:**Run the command: exit**



**exit**: This command closes your current terminal session. Itâ€™s used to log out from a remote server or close the terminal.

**Expected Outcome**: You will be logged out from the Bandit server, and you can now proceed to the next level.
