🎲 Bandit Level 9 → Level 10
🔊 Level Objective
The password for the next level is stored in a file named data.txt. The password is one of the human-readable strings in the file and is preceded by several = characters. Your task is to locate and retrieve this password.

✏️ Commands You’ll Need
cat: View the contents of a file.
strings: Extract human-readable text from binary or non-text files.
grep: Search for specific patterns in text.
exit: Log out from the server.

💡 Reminder: Always write down the passwords as you progress through the levels.

📃 Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server
Start by connecting to the Bandit server using SSH with the Bandit9 username and the password from the previous level.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
When prompted, enter the password you retrieved from Level 8.

Step 2: Analyze the File with strings
The file data.txt may contain non-readable characters. Use the strings command to extract human-readable text.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
strings data.txt
Explanation:

strings data.txt: Extracts and displays all human-readable strings from the file data.txt.
Step 3: Locate the Password Using grep
The password is preceded by several = characters. Use the grep command to search for lines containing =.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
strings data.txt | grep '='
Explanation:

strings data.txt: Extracts readable text.
|: Pipes the output of strings into the next command.
grep '=': Filters the output to show only lines containing =.
Expected Output:
You will see a line containing the password preceded by = characters.

Step 4: Identify and Note the Password
From the filtered output, identify the password (the text following the = characters). Copy it for use in the next level.

Step 5: Log Out
After retrieving the password, log out from the server.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
exit
:round_pushpin: Key Commands Recap
:one: strings: Extract human-readable text from the file.
:two: grep '=': Filter lines containing = characters.
:three: exit: Log out from the Bandit server.

🔑 Password for Level 10: (Copy the password following the = characters for future use.)

🔎 Thought Process
This level teaches how to extract meaningful data from files with mixed content:

strings is a useful tool for working with binary or non-text files, as it isolates readable characters.
grep simplifies pattern matching, helping you pinpoint specific lines of interest.
Combining strings and grep demonstrates the power of using multiple commands in sequence with pipes (|).
