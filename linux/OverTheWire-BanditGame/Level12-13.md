# üé≤ Bandit Level 12 ‚Üí Level 13



## üîä Level Objective

The password for the next level is stored in a file named **data.txt**, which is a **hexdump** of a repeatedly compressed file. You need to extract and decode it to retrieve the password.



### ‚úèÔ∏è Commands You‚Äôll Need


:asterisk: **mkdir** Create a directory.

:asterisk: **mktemp -d** Create a temporary directory with a unique name.

:asterisk: **cp** Copy files to a new location.

:asterisk: **mv** Rename or move files.

:asterisk: **xxd** Convert a hexdump back to binary.

:asterisk: **file** Determine the file type.

:asterisk: **tar, gzip, bzip2, xz** Extract compressed files.

:asterisk: **exit** Log out from the server.



üí° **Reminder**: Always write down the **passwords** as you progress through the levels.




## üìÉ Step-by-Step Solution


### Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server

Start by connecting to the Bandit server using **SSH** with the **Bandit12** username and the password from the previous level.


:white_check_mark: **Run the command: ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220**

When prompted, enter the password you retrieved from the previous level.



### Step 2: Create a Temporary Working Directory

To avoid clutter in the home directory, create a unique temporary directory under /tmp.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command: mktemp -d**


**Expected Output**: A path to a temporary directory, e.g., /tmp/tmp.ABCD1234.



### Step 3: Copy and Rename the Data File

Navigate to the temporary directory and copy the data.txt file there.

:white_check_mark: **Run the commands:**

**cd /tmp/tmp.ABCD1234**  # Replace with your temporary directory

**cp ~/data.txt**      # Copy the file to your temporary directory

**mv data.txt file.bin**  # Rename the file for clarity


### Step 4: Convert the Hexdump to Binary

Use the xxd command to revert the hexdump into a binary file.

:white_check_mark: **Run the command:** xxd -r file.bin decoded.bin



### Step 5: Extract the File

Determine the file type and extract it repeatedly until you reach the password.

white_check_mark: **Run the command:** file decoded.bin

The output will indicate the type of compression (e.g., **gzip, bzip2, tar, xz**). Extract the file using the corresponding tool, repeating the process as needed.

Examples of extraction commands:

**gzip**:

mv decoded.bin file.gz  # Rename for clarity
gunzip file.gz
bzip2:


mv decoded.bin file.bz2

bunzip2 file.bz2

tar:



tar -xf decoded.bin

xz:


mv decoded.bin file.xz

unxz file.xz


**Repeat these steps until you uncover the final file containing the password.**


### Step 6: Read the Password

Once you reach a plain text file, use cat to read its contents.

**:white_check_mark: Run the command**: **cat final_file.txt**  # Replace with the actual file name


The file will display the password for Level 13.



### Step 7: Log Out

After retrieving the password, clean up your temporary directory and log out.

:white_check_mark: **Run the commands: exit**




### :round_pushpin: Key Commands Recap


:one: **mktemp -d** Create a unique temporary directory.

:two: **cp, mv** Copy and rename files for organization.

:three: **xxd -r** Convert a hexdump back into binary.

:four: **file** Identify the file type.

:five: **gunzip, bunzip2, tar, unxz** Extract files based on their compression format.

:six: **cat** Read the contents of the file containing the password.

:seven: **rm** Clean up temporary files.

:eight: **exit** Log out from the Bandit server.

### üîé Thought Process


:arrow_right: This level introduces file compression and manipulation, demonstrating how to identify, convert, and extract files.

:arrow_right: The file command is invaluable for determining the format of an unknown file.

:arrow_right:Understanding how to handle various compression methods (gzip, bzip2, tar, xz) is essential for working with archives in real-world systems.

:arrow_right: Temporary directories (/tmp) are useful for testing and temporary workspaces.
