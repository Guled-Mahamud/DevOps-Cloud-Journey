üé≤ Bandit Level 16 ‚Üí Level 17
üîä Level Objective
The goal is to retrieve the credentials for Bandit17. The password for the next level can be obtained by submitting the current level's password to a server running on localhost (your local machine). This server is listening on a port in the range 31000‚Äì32000. Your task is to:

Find which ports have a server listening.
Identify which of these servers use SSL/TLS.
Submit the current level's password to the correct server to retrieve the credentials for Bandit17.
‚úèÔ∏è Commands You‚Äôll Need
SSH: Securely connect to the Bandit server.
nmap: Scan ports to identify active servers.
openssl s_client: Check for SSL/TLS on a port and securely communicate with the server.
exit: Log out from the server.

üí° Reminder: Always write down the passwords as you progress through the levels.

üìÉ Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Connect to the Bandit Server
Connect to the Bandit server using SSH with the Bandit16 username and the password from the previous level.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
When prompted, enter the password you retrieved from Level 15.

Step 2: Scan for Open Ports
Use the nmap command to scan for open ports in the range 31000‚Äì32000 on localhost.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
Explanation:

nmap: Scans the network to discover open ports.
-p 31000-32000: Specifies the range of ports to scan.
localhost: Refers to the local machine (the Bandit server).
The output will list the ports that have servers listening.

Step 3: Test Ports for SSL/TLS Support
For each open port, use the openssl s_client command to check if the server supports SSL/TLS.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
openssl s_client -connect localhost:<port>
Replace <port> with the port number from the previous step.

Explanation:

openssl s_client: A tool to test SSL/TLS connections.
-connect localhost:<port>: Attempts to connect to the specified port using SSL/TLS.
If the server supports SSL/TLS, you will see SSL handshake information in the output. Otherwise, the connection will fail.

Step 4: Submit the Password
Once you identify the server that supports SSL/TLS, connect to it and submit the current level's password.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
openssl s_client -connect localhost:<correct_port>
After connecting, paste the password for Bandit16 and press Enter.

Step 5: Retrieve the Credentials
The correct server will respond with the credentials for Bandit17. Copy the password for use in the next level.

Step 6: Log Out
After retrieving the password, log out from the Bandit server.

Run the command:

bash
Copy code
exit
:round_pushpin: Key Commands Recap
:one: SSH: Connect to the Bandit server.
:two: nmap: Locate active servers by scanning for open ports.
:three: openssl s_client: Check for SSL/TLS and securely send data to the server.
:four: exit: Log out from the Bandit server.

üîë Password for Level 17: (Copy the server's response for future use.)

üîé Thought Process
This level emphasizes network troubleshooting and security techniques:

nmap identifies active services.
openssl s_client tests for SSL/TLS and securely communicates with servers.
These are fundamental tools in system administration and cybersecurity, helping you navigate secure server communications efficiently.
