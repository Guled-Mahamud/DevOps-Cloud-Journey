#  Learning Git

I learned how to use GitHub to manage my own projects and keep everything organised. I practiced making commits to save my changes, pulling updates when needed, and pushing my work to my repositories. I also learned how to create and work with branches to keep my tasks separate and fix merge conflicts when combining changes. 


Using GitHub has helped me track my progress and stay in control of my work. I now feel confident managing my projects, keeping my code organized, and making updates efficiently using GitHub.
