# Git Merge Pancake Recipe

After creating the new branch **Update/README**, I’ve added the pancake recipe to the **README** file in that branch. This way, the changes won’t affect the main branch. Once I’m done, I can push the changes, merge them, and then pull the latest updates.


Please see the steps below
