# :desktop_computer: Welcome to my DevOps/Cloud learning journey

I have over 5 years of experience working in IT service desk support, helping with both hardware and software issues, remotely and in person. During this time, I’ve worked with different companies and used many tools to provide support.

Now, I’m upskilling to become a DevOps/Cloud Engineer. I’ve joined the Coder Co Bootcamp to help me structure my learning and dive into the exciting world of DevOps. This repository is my learning log and resource for anyone interested in following along as I explore key DevOps concepts and tools.

## :microphone: What is DevOps?

DevOps combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to make building, testing, and releasing software faster and more reliable. A DevOps Engineer automates workflows, manages infrastructure as code, and ensures smooth deployment pipelines using tools like Kubernetes and Terraform.
