# :desktop_computer: Welcome to my DevOps/Cloud learning journey

With 5 years of experience in IT service desk support, I have developed a strong foundation in troubleshooting hardware and software issues, installing and configuring operating systems, managing user accounts, and resolving network connectivity problems.

Now, I am building on this experience to upskill and transition into a DevOps/Cloud Engineer role. To achieve this, I’ve joined the Coder Co Bootcamp to structure my learning and deepen my understanding of DevOps. This repository is my learning journal, where I share my progress, key concepts, and the skills I’m gaining in DevOps and cloud technologies.


## :microphone: What is DevOps?

DevOps combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to make building, testing, and releasing software faster and more reliable. A DevOps Engineer automates workflows, manages infrastructure as code, and ensures smooth deployment pipelines using tools like Kubernetes and Terraform.
