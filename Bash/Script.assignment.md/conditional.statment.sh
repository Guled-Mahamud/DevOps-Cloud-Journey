#Conditional Statements - Write a script that checks if a file exists and prints a message indicating whether it exists or not. If it exists, the script should also check if the file is readable, writable, or executable. 


#!/bin/bash



mkdir MyDirectory

cd MyDirectory

touch guled.txt

echo "Hello, here is your file." > guled.txt


echo "Contents of guled.txt:"
cat guled.txt

echo "Enter the file name to check:"
read filename

if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    echo "The file '$filename' exists."

    # Check file permissions
    [ -r "$filename" ] && echo "It is readable."
    [ -w "$filename" ] && echo "It is writable."
    [ -x "$filename" ] && echo "It is executable."
else
    echo "The file '$filename' does not exist."
